# insta_modern

An simple implementation of modern instagram UI just for practicing and experience purpose.
This code doesn't use a backend server to fetch data or state management for handle data flow. But for simplicity use dummy static data.

## Getting Started

This UI Design totaly inspired by a Dribble design. I put the dribble source link at follow.
